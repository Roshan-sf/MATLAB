% Problem 4) You are deciding on materials for the external  portion of
% your spacecraft and you are worried about contamination.  The next few
% questions deal with this problem. part a) Calculate and plot the
% residence time for temperatures from  50-300 K at activation energies of
% 10 and 20 kcal/mole.  Put the lines  on a single plot. Use Ï„0=3x10-12.
% Hint: I use semilogx (logs the x axis to be able to see the results
% better). Use R=1.9858775*10^-3 kcal/K*mole.

Question 11)
Recently, there has been increasing interest in using deployable  sails to deorbit satellites in low orbits at the end of their useful  lifetimes. This increases their rate of orbit decay and removes the  spacecraft from active orbits faster than natural decay. Assume k =  1.38e-23 J/K, g = 9.81 m/s2, R = 8.314 J/(mol*K, mass density =  1.2023e-13 kg/m3, scale height = 124 km. if you need any of these  values. 
Part a) Calculate the time taken to naturally de-orbit (with no sail) a 1 kg satellite with frontal area 100 cm2(CubeSat idea) from an initial operational circular orbit at 800 km. Use a  snapshot of the orbital lifetime (display the time in days to the  nearest day).

Question 13)
Problem 6 Recently, there has been increasing  interest in using deployable sails to deorbit satellites in low orbits  at the end of their useful lifetimes. This increases their rate of orbit decay and removes the spacecraft from active orbits faster than natural decay. Assume k = 1.38e-23 J/K, g = 9.81 m/s2, R = 8.314 J/(mol*K, mass density = 1.2023e-13 kg/m3, scale height = 124 km if you need any of  these values.

Question 15)
Problem 7
When its apogee kick motor fails, a satellite intended for a geo-synchronous orbit is stranded in LEO in a 320 km circular orbit. The silver array  interconnects are now exposed to an unexpected higher fluence of atomic  oxygen that will erode them badly.
Part a) Plot the erosion depth (cm) due to atomic oxygen over time (per day  for a year) for solar minimum, solar maximum and solar average  conditions, assuming the solar arrays are always facing the ram  direction. Use the AO density table provided.  The table gives altitude  in km, number density for AO [1/m3] for solar min and solar max.

rhomax = AOD(7,3)/1000000; %convrt to cm^3

%% Question 16)       

Problem 7
part b) What is the erosion depth in cm to two decimal places at 1 
year for solar max.
disp(num2str(maxE(end)));
Question 17)
Problem 7: 
Part c) If the silver interconnects are circular with a diameter of 0.04 cm, how much time does the company have to launch a rescue mission to  install a new kick motor before atomic oxygen creates mission failure?  Report the values in days to one day at solar max.       
[value, pos] = min(abs(maxE - 0.04)); %find the value closest to 0.04

% Please read this for the last problem!
% So the closest calculated value of erosion (in cm) to 0.04 is 0.03989, 
% but technically the mission is still live because there is still some 
% material left. However, after the next day the erosion is at 0.04059 cm, 
% meaning that sometime during the 58th day the silver completely eroded 
% away. Because 0.03989 is closer to 0.04 than 0.04059, 
% I am inclined to believe that the material completely 
% eroded in the beginning half of the 58th day so I would round 
% down and that is my answer.
