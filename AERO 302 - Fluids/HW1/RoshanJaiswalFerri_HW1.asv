%The fluid properties of viscocity vary between micro and macroscopic
%perspectives. On a macroscopic level viscosity can be viewed as internal
%forces that slow down a fluid. On a microscopic level viscosity is seen as
%the exchange of momentum between fluid molecules, generally slowing them
%down. When the temperature rises the molecules inside the fluid become
%excited - introducing more energy, therefore increasing the speed at which
%the fluid moves.

%Changing viscosity due to temperature â€” Sutherland's Law

Temp = -50:1:500; %in C
TempK = Temp + 273.15; %in K

%muAir
muRef = 1.716e-5; %pa/s
Tref = 273.15; %K
Sair = 110.4; %K

%Sutherland's Law:

muAir = (((TempK./Tref).^1.5).*((Tref+Sair)./TempK+Sair)).*muRef;

%From a Microscopic Perspective viscosity is dependant on pressure, the
%higher the pressure the closer molecules are together resulting in more
%collisions. On the other hand, from a macroscopic perspective, Viscocity
%is largely not dependant on pressure.
